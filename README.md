Immersive Mapping

This is a simple 3D map which shows buildigns and traffic based on a location of the user's choice. The visualization was created through Mapbox SDK to Unity 3D. Visualization wise - the map is extremely basic with terrain loaded from Mapbox's street imagery and building design from Unity's assests. 

I encountered a couple of issues with the map, the first being I have no clue how to host the map to github pages (hopefully the gif below would suffice). Secondly, Unity was running at snail's pace on the mac and hence the limited experimentation I could do within the map. The idea of the map is highly basic, but it was a nice introduction to Unity x Mapbox. 

Hopefully in the future I can add a lot more interactivity such as adding traffic flow rather than having it static/ have the buildings be more true to their actual look (e.g Shanghai Pearl Tower is technically Pink, but Unity adds its own basic layer over the buildings)

Here is a gif (I struggled to load it gitpages)
